        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Hi everyone! I am Felmyr Jhude Gamboa, currently a second year college student in PUP Sta. Mesa studying the course Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 
            I joined this family in order to learn new skills and expand my comfort zone, to look forward to the future and gain skills I can use in my life. 
            Right now, I am still learning things around me especially with the things related with my course such as programming. Back when I started college last year, 
            I don't even have an idea of how programming really works that's why I am looking forward to learn new things this year with this family!</p>

        <h2> My Hobbies </h2>
        <p> Listed here are the hobbies I am really fond of doing everyday! </p>
        <h3> Sleeping </h3>
        <li>
            Having enough sleep especially when you have nothing to do is the best thing you can do in this college setting!
        </li>
        <h3> Video Games </h3>
        <li>
            Sometimes when I get bored and nothing to do, I play video games such as Mobile Legends, Project Sekai, and Roblox!
        </li>
        <h3> Sports </h3>
        <li> 
            Lastly, whenever I feel athletic or feel to move to make my body fit, I usually watch or play sports such as badminton. I sometimes immitate the moves
            of the notable and top players in their matches while watching. XD
