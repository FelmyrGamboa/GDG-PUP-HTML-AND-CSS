        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Hi everyone! I am Felmyr Jhude Gamboa, currently a second year college student in PUP Sta. Mesa studying the course Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 
            I joined this family in order to learn new skills and expand my comfort zone, to look forward to the future and gain skills I can use in my life. 
            Right now, I am still learning things around me especially with the things related with my course such as programming. Back when I started college last year, 
            I don't even have an idea of how programming really works that's why I am looking forward to learn new things this year with this family!</p>
